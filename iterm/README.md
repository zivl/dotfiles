# iTerm

During the setup process, Solarized color scheme will be installed into your iTerm. Go to Profiles => Colors => Load Presets to pick Solarized Dark.

Here are the customisations:

- Font: 15pt Source Code Pro for Powerline (should be installed to Font Book App)
- Uncheck `Use Lion-style full screen` on General. This will give you fast full screen windows that are switchable without switching to spaces
